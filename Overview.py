    This App will help you to predict the arrivals and departures of bikes at each station, to find the nearest locations with Divvy Bicycle available \U0001F600
    
    # \U0001F310 Problem
    At peak hours, often impossible to find a bike (empty station) or to park it (full station) especially under rainy or cold conditions
    - Station is full: user cannot park their bike
    - Station is empty: user cannot find any bike
    
    Typical scenario in the morning to commute to work: no bike close to home, full stations in the business district. 

    # \U0001F50E Solution
    What? Being able to predict bike availability in advance depending on time of day and weather forecast
    
    How? By predicting the number of arrivals and departures of bikes at each station depending on three factors:  
    - Time of the day 
    - Weather conditions
    - Location

    # \U0001F4C1 Data Collection
    Divvy bike sharing and station data from divvy website and StationAPI
    - Flows of bike rides between stations
    - Stations GPS coordinates
    - Time dimension (hour of day, day of week, month, year)
    
    Weather conditions from Open Weather API
    - Temperature
    - Humidity
    - wind speed
    - Cloudiness


    # üîß Data Cleaning & Preprocessing
    ‚úîÔ∏èSlicing the city of Chicago into areas, identifying to which area bike stations belong to
    
    ‚úîÔ∏èComputing the average number of departures and arrivals per station for a given area, for a given day and hour
    
    ‚úîÔ∏èSelecting weather information (temperature, humidity, wind speed, cloudiness) corresponding to this day and hour 
    
    ‚úîÔ∏èWhat we want to predict: avg nb or arrivals/departures for a given day and hour in a given area 
    
    ‚úîÔ∏èFactors used for such prediction: 
    - weather information, 
    - time specific effect, 
    - geographic specific effect
